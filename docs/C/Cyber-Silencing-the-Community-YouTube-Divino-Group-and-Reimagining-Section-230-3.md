## PART II: SPEECH ON THE INTERNET AND SECTION 230
There exists, understandably, widespread confusion about what exactly is protected or protectable speech when it comes to online platforms. Articles and debates on the nature of free speech on the internet—and whether the internet should be regulated—have existed since the birth of the internet as a medium for communications.<sup>73</sup> As early as 1996, “cyberspace activist” John Perry Barlow poetically declared:

>> Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather.

>> We have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one, so I address you with no greater authority than that with which liberty itself always speaks. I declare the global social space we are building to be naturally independent of the tyrannies you seek to impose on us. You have no moral right to rule us nor do you possess any methods of enforcement we have true reason to fear. <sup>74</sup>

Although Barlow—someone with “no technical expertise” but who held “a reputation as a prophet of new technology”<sup>75</sup>—and his sympathizers may have had sweeping ideals surrounding what they hoped was a cyberlibertarian future, those ideals have not truly come to pass. They have, however, been ingrained in the debate over whether speech on the internet is “free” and whether the internet is, or ought to be, considered separate from the “real world”<sup>76</sup> and thus regulated or deregulated in a unique manner.

### A. The Necessity of, and Unintended Consequences from, Private Moderation

#### *1. “Free Speech” as a Moving Target*

Internet speech regulation and moderation entered the purview of the Supreme Court early on, and the Court has a history of selectively eschewing regulation of internet-based speech. In 1997 in *Reno v. ACLU*, the Court ruled that restrictions on the “display” and “transmission” of what was deemed “indecent” communications online violated the First Amendment, lending credence to the idea that internet speech is truly free.<sup>77</sup> However, five years later in 2002—as the internet, and access to it, was broadening exponentially—the Court grappled with definitions of protected expression and obscenity. In *Ashcroft v. Free Speech*

Coalition, the Court found that “virtual” child pornography not involving actual children was “protected expression” under the First Amendment. <sup>78</sup> Later that year in *Ashcroft v. ACLU*, the Court upheld the Child Online Protection Act (COPA)<sup>79</sup> as a means of regulating expression, but remanded to the lower court for a determination as to what constituted “obscenity law” in the modern age.<sup>80</sup> Since that time the landscape, and very nature, of the internet has evolved in such a manner that regulation has become increasingly necessary. The First Amendment question has shifted from a conversation around obscenity and protection of children to one of threatening (or, “true threat”)<sup>81</sup> language and spread of misinformation.<sup>82</sup> As authors on Bloomberg put it in June of 2021, “the debate is over how, not whether, to filter what’s said online.”<sup>83</sup>

#### *2. Shifting Sands and the Social Media Debate*
In the twenty years since *Ashcroft v. ACLU*, the makeup and content of the internet has become virtually unrecognizable compared to that shared on earlier platforms. When *Ashcroft* was decided, accessing information online was a markedly slower task <sup>84</sup> and the percentage of people using the internet was far smaller. According to Pew Research Center, 82% of American adults were on the internet in 2015.<sup>85</sup> That percentage, in 2000, was 50%,<sup>86</sup> but with a significant portion of those users being between the ages of 18-29.<sup>87</sup> The draw for younger adults was not to locate information or even share news; the internet in the early 2000s was primarily a source of entertainment and of limited connectivity with a

pre-existing group of friends.<sup>88</sup> A staggering 92% of that same age bracket were active users in 2015.<sup>89</sup> Among senior citizens, a demographic most often targeted by misinformation and “fake news” efforts,<sup>90</sup> the percentage of internet users spiked from 14% in 2000 to 58% in 2015, <sup>91</sup> with the majority becoming active online after 2012.<sup>92</sup>

Why is this important? Simply put, the internet is being used less as a place of sporadic connectivity and more as an intrinsic part of people’s everyday lives. Society relies on the internet for news, communication, creative content, audio and video streaming, and much, much more—including use of, and access to, the phenomenon of “social media.” <sup>93</sup> Social media is a development that evolved from a mere profile-uploading service in 1997 to the platforms we think of today:<sup>94</sup> Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Snapchat, and TikTok, primarily. <sup>95</sup> Although they are privately-owned entities, the fact that they frequently host content which is available for widespread public consumption has led to broad confusion about the platforms’ rights to censor that content. <sup>96</sup> YouTube is a privately-owned content provider that hosts user-created content and encourages content sharing. It is by definition “social media,” and subject to the same confusion that plagues other hosts of user speech.

#### *3. YouTube, Despite Its Publicly Shareable Content, is Not a Public Site*

Most of the world would consider YouTube to be a “public” site; however, it, as a social media platform (and the most popular one as of 2021), <sup>97</sup> is anything but. Because social media platforms are not considered public forums,<sup>98</sup> they are largely free to censor user content, with the exception that government accounts on those

platforms may not silence users who are responding to the government’s speech. <sup>99</sup> Despite this, the internet and “social media in particular”<sup>100</sup> have become critical for the expression of protected speech. <sup>101</sup> Jack Dorsey, the creator of Twitter, stated in 2018 that he believes Twitter *should* be a “public square” where “activists, marginalized communities, whistleblowers, journalists, governments and the most influential people in the world” have an “open and free exchange” of ideas.<sup>102</sup> Recently, in April of 2022, billionaire Elon Musk of Tesla and SpaceX offered to purchase Twitter for $44 billion, stating that “free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated.”<sup>103</sup> Musk’s offer was accepted,<sup>104</sup> but critics have already levied harsh opinions against Musk and his Barlow-esque dream of a cyberlibertarian platform.<sup>105</sup> Those critics point out that a lack of moderation leads not only to a free-for-all arena for hate speech and bigotry,<sup>106</sup> but also potential legal implications if Musk intends not to moderate Twitter’s European users. <sup>107</sup>

Regardless of Dorsey and Musk’s idealistic visions, only the government—not private platforms—can affirmatively create new public spaces. <sup>108</sup> The government has not done so in the context of social media generally; the exception lies in (correctly) labeling the official account pages of government officials as being truly public. <sup>109</sup>

This affirmative lack of government action in social media was the crux of the reason that Judge DeMarchi opted to dismiss the plaintiffs’ complaint in *Divino Group.* The plaintiffs’ first claim, for violation of their First Amendment rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, <sup>110</sup> failed because to state a claim under § 1983, plaintiffs “must plead facts showing that a person acting under color of state law proximately

caused a violation of their constitutional or other federal rights.”<sup>111</sup> Here, the plaintiffs acknowledged that Google et al. were private entities, but attempted to argue that the defendants “should be considered state actors” because the defendants “designated” YouTube as a public forum for free expression.<sup>112</sup> Unfortunately for the plaintiffs, no person was acting under color of state law, nor did any government authority designate the platform a “public forum.”

The “public forum” label is one that platforms and courts tend to eschew due to the substantial inferences associated with it. In 2018, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook (now “Meta”)<sup>113</sup> avoided answering Senator Ted Cruz’s repeated questions relating to whether Facebook was a “neutral public forum.”<sup>114</sup> Similarly, in *Prager University v. Google LLC (“Prager III”),* the Ninth Circuit overtly and directly stated that YouTube is not a public forum.<sup>115</sup> This seems counterintuitive considering the growing importance of the internet as a means of communication, notably among “digital natives” (“[c]hildren and young people born into and raised in a digital world (post-1980)”), <sup>116</sup> but the reality is that platforms can censor as they wish.<sup>117</sup>

The internet’s role in public debate was particularly visible during both the 2020 United States election cycle and the COVID-19 pandemic.<sup>118</sup> Fake news media sources and “echo chambers”<sup>10</sup> proved extremely problematic,<sup>119</sup> leading to

politically-based arguments over whether platforms were unfairly favoring a particular viewpoint in the wake of profound tides of misinformation. <sup>121</sup>

But rather than treat platforms as truly public, many (successfully) called for the platforms to create and enact policies purporting to fight that misinformation.<sup>122</sup> Even Reddit—whose self-proclaimed policy is to allow “open and authentic” debate—now selectively bans and moderates content on its platform.<sup>123</sup> Similarly, many platforms only selectively censor content,<sup>124</sup> with the larger platforms opting to do so by algorithm.<sup>125</sup>

Without critical eyes on the datasets that such algorithms use for moderation, “benign” content—such as Sal Bardo’s—is at risk for inappropriate or unintended moderation.<sup>126</sup> While a deeper discussion of the unintended and evidently biased results of algorithmic moderation is beyond the scope of this paper, it is notable that algorithmic bias is a topic of debate for both regulatory authorities and technology content providers.<sup>127</sup> Whether manual or algorithmic, any undue or

One part of the *Divino Group* dismissal was based on Judge DeMarchi’s assessment of the plaintiffs’ claim that, by leaning on Section 230 of the CDA, the defendants’ “private conduct bec[ame] state action ‘endorsed’ by the federal government.”<sup>128</sup> Judge DeMarchi relied on *Prager III* in determining that YouTube’s “hosting of speech on a private platform is not a traditional and exclusive government function” and that the Supreme Court has “consistently declined to find that private entities engage in state action, except in limited circumstances.”<sup>129</sup> Judge DeMarchi stated that the standard is to “start with the presumption that conduct by private actors is not state action. [Plaintiff] bears the burden of establishing that Defendants were state actors.”<sup>130</sup>

However, Judge DeMarchi did not directly address the protections granted by Section 230, other than to say that Section 230 was designed “to keep government interference in [internet communication] to a minimum.”<sup>131</sup> In so doing, Judge DeMarchi followed a long trend of selective application and misapplication of Section 230 protections. <sup>132</sup> Such misapplication is understandable given the law’s tenuous relationship with technology, but no longer acceptable considering the current socially-focused state of the internet—and the fact that the CDA was enacted in 1996, twenty-five years earlier than the *Divino Group* (and other related) decisions.

### C. The Intent of Section 230 and What Needs to Change

Section 230 has an astonishing amount of deference afforded to it by courts and tech moguls alike, often due to their misunderstanding of the intent behind the legislation. <sup>133</sup> Just recently, the Supreme Court denied a request to “clarify the meaning” of the law, a request made because so often the people bringing complaints against it fail to ascertain the purpose of the writing.<sup>134</sup> Justice Thomas has opined that lower courts wrongly read more expansive protections than the Act was intended for,<sup>135</sup> while Presidents Trump and Biden have both espoused distrust of the law and argued for its removal or revision (each in different ways).<sup>136</sup>

Just what was the intent behind Section 230? Section 230 is part of the Communications Decency Act (“CDA”), a piece of legislation that stemmed from the general idea that Congress should protect internet users—particularly children—from accessing unwanted materials such as pornography on the newlyburgeoning World Wide Web.<sup>137</sup> The CDA was Senator James Exon’s “battle” against pornographers, those he would refer to as “barbarians” at the digital gate, luring children in, causing the internet to become a “red light district.”<sup>138</sup> The House thoroughly and hotly debated the CDA’s constitutionality; Exon’s language was so far overreaching that even Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich opposed it. <sup>139</sup> Gingrich stated that Exon’s proposed limitations on access were “clearly a violation of free speech and … the right of adults to communicate with each other.”<sup>140</sup>

Amidst the debate over the CDA, a 1995 case, *Stratton Oakmont, Inc. v. Prodigy Servs.* Co. [hereinafter Prodigy] was brought to the courts. 141 In Prodigy, a New York state court found an internet platform, Prodigy, liable for defamation because a Prodigy user had claimed that a bank had committed securities fraud; that

is to say, the court decided that Prodigy had the same “publisher” liabilities as a traditional newspaper or other published source in acting as the “speaker” responsible for third-party content.<sup>142</sup> This holding differed from that of an earlier New York case, *Cubby, Inc. v. CompuServe, Inc.*, in which CompuServe was found not to be a “publisher” of online content.<sup>143</sup> The *Prodigy* court distinguished its case by stating that Prodigy, unlike CompuServe, had adopted content standards that likened it enough to a traditional publisher that similar liabilities should apply.<sup>144</sup>

In May of 1995, during the debate surrounding the CDA, *Prodigy* was decided. Immediately following that decision, two Congressmen who had some insight into technologies, Representatives Chris Cox and Ron Wyden, managed to realize what effect labeling online platforms as “publishers” would have on the growth of the internet and tied that into an amendment to the CDA.<sup>145</sup> The Cox-Wyden amendment, titled the “Internet Freedom and Family Empowerment Act,”<sup>146</sup> was introduced in June of 1995 as House Bill 1555 (104th Cong.).<sup>147</sup> Cox stated that their bill would “protect computer Good Samaritans, online service providers, anyone who provides a front end to the Internet … who takes steps to screen indecency;”<sup>148</sup> their bill would protect those entities from liability.<sup>149</sup> Cox and Wyden thus introduced the language that would become Section 230. It was this language that convinced the House to pass a version of the CDA.<sup>150</sup>

The language of Section 230(c)(1) reads: “No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.”<sup>151</sup> This language has been deemed “the twenty-six words that created the Internet.”<sup>152</sup> It enabled the free exchange of information online while protecting the hosts of that information from liability for speech that they simply could not logistically or feasibly control; in short, “Section 230 allowed companies such as Prodigy to determine what moderation practices and policies best serve their users, without being exposed to massive potential liability.” <sup>153</sup> Additionally, Section 230(c)(2) provides immunity for platforms that remove or restrict content that they consider “obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable,

whether or not such material is constitutionally protected.”<sup>154</sup> This is the language that platforms rely on in moderating, censoring, and demonetizing.

The House version of the CDA which contained Section 230, and the earlier Senate version, each became part of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (“TCA”). <sup>155</sup> A year later in *Reno v. ACLU*, the Supreme Court struck down the provisions of the TCA that made up the CDA—all except Section 230. <sup>156</sup> Thus Exon’s battle against pornography generally disappeared from the TCA, and Section 230 now stands alone, with no context to clarify its meaning.

Section 230 was, and is, an incredibly important piece of legislation. In some ways it continues to serve its purpose admirably even after twenty-five years. However, our digital universe has changed. Social media like YouTube (not yet imagined in 1996) is a vital source of visibility, connectivity, and income for marginalized groups of creators such as those in the LGBTQ+ community. Allowing Section 230 to fully protect platforms from liability for inappropriate removal or flagging of income-bearing (and not otherwise violent, lewd, et cetera) content made by those creators, who rely on the platform for both exposure and income, is objectively a misapplication of the statute. The solution lies in a simple amendment.
