**Abstract.** While organizations benefit from lower operating costs resulting from higher quality and quantity of work when employees are engaged in their work, (Risher, 2018). This study used the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (Schuafeli & Bakker, 2004) to uncover the work engagement levels of county extension agents at one University. Findings suggest Extension agents report Florida Extension agents reported possessing high levels of self-perceived work engagement. These findings were consistent with other previous research (Abbott, 2017; Weyrauch, 2010) which likewise found Extension agents often or very often report dedication.
