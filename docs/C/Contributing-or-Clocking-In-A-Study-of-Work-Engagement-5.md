## FINDINGS
The purpose of the study was to describe the current levels of work engagement reported by Florida Extension agents as determined by the UWES. As shown in Table 1, respondents reported being engaged by their work with a tendency to very often exhibit dedication (*M* = 5.76, *SD* = .90), and often exhibit absorption (*M* = 5.43, *SD* = .87) and vigor (*M* = 5.41, *SD* = .90).

Table 2 displays responses related to the construct of vigor. Responding agents tended to often experience vigor. Almost 70% of participants (n = 145) responded very often or always to the statement, “I can continue to working for very long periods of time.” Similarly, 67.47% of participants (n = 145) responded very often or always to the statement, “At my work I always persevere, even when things don’t go well.”

Table 3 displays responses related to the construct of dedication. Respondents reported that they very often experience dedication. Over 80% of participants (n = 73) responded *very often* or *always* to the statement, “To me, my job is challenging,” while 72.72% of participants (n = 139) responded very often or always to the statement, “To me, my job is challenging.”

Table 4 displays responses related to the construct of absorption. Participants reported often experiencing absorption. Almost 70% (n = 147) of participants responded often or *very often* to the statement, “Time flies when I am working.” Responding agents were least affirmative to the statement, “It is difficult to detach myself from my job,” with only 49.05% (n = 102) responding often or very often to the statement, “It is difficult to detach myself from my work.”
