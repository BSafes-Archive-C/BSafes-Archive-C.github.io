## IV. THE PUSH FOR FEDERAL LEGISLATION TO UNIFY A NOTICE STANDARD AND ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS
The best path forward to address these concerns may be the implementation of a federal data breach notification standard. Sectorial federal notification requirements are in place, depending on the industry, with the granddaddy of such legislation being the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).<sup>36</sup> Harmon concludes that “[t]he federal government is best situated to implement these

See 45 C.F.R. § 164.402 (2022) (defining breach as the “acquisition, access, use, or disclosure of protected health information”).

changes by issuing its own data breach notification law, both because of its broad jurisdiction and because of its better access to relevant information on the state of technological advancements.”<sup>37</sup>

While data breach notification bills continue to be proposed at the federal level, none have advanced far in Congress, and they primarily address unifying requirements and notification timelines rather than access and evolving technologies.<sup>38</sup> For example, Senators Warner, Rubio, and Collins proposed the “Cyber Incident Notification Act of 2021”<sup>39</sup> which required certain covered entities to report cyber intrusions or potential cyber intrusions, within twenty-four hours. However, notably missing was a definition of cyber intrusion, which the Bill left up to rulemaking authorities.

Federal legislation aimed at addressing these concerns would be welcome but should equally be built with the flexibility to withstand emerging cyber incidents and technology.
